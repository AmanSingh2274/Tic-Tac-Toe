## Introduction

This Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to play the classic game in a console environment. The game handles player turns, checks for win conditions, and detects draws. It is a great way to understand the basics of game logic and control structures in Java.

## Features

- Simple console-based interface
- Player turn handling
- Win condition checks for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Draw condition detection
- Easy-to-read code with comments for better understanding

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-java.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe-java
3. Compile the java code:
   ```bash
   javac TicTacToe.java

## Gameplay
-The game board is a 3x3 grid.

-Players take turns to enter their move (row and column) when prompted.

-The game checks for a win or draw after each move.

-If a player wins, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the game ends.

-If the game is a draw, a message is displayed, and the game ends.
